random word order

GOALS:

I got DB!
Those csv dates give me a headache. History is available on the Github. Could recover, not sure if it worth the time. Yes, it has 2 months worth of bending verbs, but apart from almostThere and Perfect10 it has little use. By the time I will come around making dashboard, it will be absolute.

Still signing with 2019. 
A2 part worked fine in A222. A22 part need to be investigated. Strings of 2 is not an appropriate way to name the different versions of the code. 
*Removed cues for Irregular Joe/A2.*
AlmostThere is increased to 5 distances.

Changed W+C to Ctrl+C. At the moment it is painful, as I am half re-trained on W+C. Wrote script for Jamie to concatenate csv. IK, this is not related to Norwegian, but at the moment I don't keep general daily log.

Anders gave me Norwegian keyboard. Allegedly, he has given it to me before, however, I cannot recall. Probably, when I was depressed while taking Descriptive analytics.

Would need to rewrite everything in st. What a gem!!!

Cleaned verbs.xlsx with two options for answer. 

FuzzyWuzzy appears to be working only with English. Nice to know that to Eddie closest word from my corpus is 'dø'. XD
In addition, vocabulary needs to be expanded.

HS, need to figure out how amend only one sheet, without deleting other sheets.

Add progress bar, to go through them takes forever (45 minutes !!!) 
Verbs.xlsx is so dirty, extra spaces, half of them don't have 'å' or 'har', some has 2 or 3 variants of the past.
