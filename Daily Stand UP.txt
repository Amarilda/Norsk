Changed W+C to Ctrl+C. At the moment it is painful, as I am half re-trained on W+C. Wrote script for Jamie to concatenate csv. IK, this is not related to Norwegian, but at the moment I don't keep general daily log.

Anders gave me Norwegian keyboard. Allegedly, he has given it to me before, however, I cannot recall. Probably, when I was depressed while taking Descriptive analytics.

Would need to rewrite everything in st. What a gem!!!

Cleaned verbs.xlsx with two options for answer. 

FuzzyWuzzy appears to be working only with English. Nice to know that to Eddie closest word from my corpus is 'dø'. XD
In addition, vocabulary needs to be expanded.

HS, need to figure out how amend only one sheet, without deleting other sheets.

Add progress bar, to go through them takes forever (45 minutes !!!) 
Verbs.xlsx is so dirty, extra spaces, half of them don't have 'å' or 'har', some has 2 or 3 variants of the past.
